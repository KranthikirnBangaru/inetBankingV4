Agile model/ Agile methodology/Agile Process:
---------------------------------------------

	It is an iterative and incremental Approach.

Iterative : same kind of process repeat again and again.
-----------

Incremental: we will implement some feature of begining in the software then we keep on adding new modules or features existing softwares.
------------

* Agile is iterative and incremental

Agile principles:
-----------------
* customer no need to weight till the complete software is develop.
* we develop, test and release a piece of software & Deliver to the customer with few number of features.
* we can accept/accomodate requirement changes.
* In Agile delivery is very faster.

There will be good communication between Customer, business Analyst, Developer and Testers.

Advantages:
-----------
- Requirement changes are allowed in any stage of development or we can accommodate requirement changes in the middle of development.
- Release will be very fast.
- Customer no need to wait for long time.
- It is very easy model to adopt.
- Good comminication between team.

Disadvantages:
--------------

- Less focus on design and documentation, since we deliver software is very faster.

Scrum:
------
	Scrum is a framework through which we develop and test the build software finally we release the software to the customer. product by following Agile priciples.

	Scrum is a framework through which we build software by following Agile priciples.

Scrum Team:
-----------
Product Owner
Scrum master
Dev Team
QA Team

Product owner: 	Define the features of the product.
-------------  	Prioritize features according to market value.
		Adjust features and priority every Iteration, as needed 
		accept or reject work result.

Scrum master:	The main role is facilitating and driving the agile process. will organize the meetings. 
-------------	
 
Dev & QA Team:	Develop and test the software. perform the tasks. 
--------------

Scrum terminology:
------------------

- User Story: it represent feature/Module in a software. samll requirement.

- Epic: collection of user stories. large requirement.

- Product backlog: contains list of user stories. prepared by product owner. product owner will prepare the product backlog by taking all the requirement 
		   from the customer and and convert them into stories epics they will put them as a list.
		 - it contains all the stories from the product every story will return in the product back log.
		 - it contains all the requirements and all the stories return by the product owner. 

- Sprint/Iteration : Period of time to complete the user stories, sprint cycle will be decided by the product owner and team, usually 2-4 weeks of time.

sprint planning meeting: Meeting conducts with the team to define what can be delivered in the sprint and duration.
------------------------

   1. how many stories we have in the backlog 
   2. how many stories we are going to develop and test during the sprint. 
   3. what is the duration of the sprint.

Sprint backlog: List of committed stories by Dev/QA for specific sprint. specific number of stories or commited stories by developer and QA. they are ready for Dev and test.
--------------		  We have only few number of stories which is comitted by bthe dev and QA for specific sprint.

Scrum meeting: meeting conducted by scrum master everyday 15mins. called as scrum call/standup meeting. this meet conducted by scrum master. scrum master is responsible
--------------           for facilitating and driving the process. s.m. will track the entire status. 
	
	- In this meeting Developers & QA scrum master, sometimes Product owner also part of this meeting.
	- everyday 15mins. spend discuss the status of stories.
	- How Devloper is doing. Tester are doing. Developer task is going in time or not. they are facing any issue. all these things should discuss in scrum meeting.


sprint retrospective meeting: conducts meeting after completion of sprint. the entire team, including both the scrum master and the product owner
----------------------------	should participate.(discussed about tasks challanges problems, facing issues).


Story point: Rough estimation of user stories, will be given by Dev and QA in the form of Fibonacci series.
-----------
		or   It is an estimation given by Tester and Dev for specific Story.
	During sprint planning Developer & QA will sit together and they will give estimation for every story.

	0  1  1  2  3  5  8 . . . . 
1story point = 1 hour/1day(6hr)

Login ---> Dev-5 QA-3 = 8hours / 1day

Burndown chart: shows how much work remaining in the sprint. Maintained by the scrum master daily.
---------------
 
Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Team

Artefacts: Product backlog, Sprint Backlog/Burndown chart.

Ceremonies: Sprint planning, Daily scrum, Sprint Review.


Scrum Board:
------------
Stories, To Do, In progress, Testing, Done.


Release Planning: all the teams will decide how many sprints are required and each sprint how many stories we have to develop and Test. 
-----------------

sprint Planning: what are the stories we have to develop and Test. what is the duration of the sprint. what are the different task developer will do. what are the 
		 different task tester will do, what is the estimation all these things discussed to the sprint planning meeting.


Advantages of Agile Scrum:

- we can save time and cost of the project.
- The quality can be ensured because each and every sprint will be tested mutltiple times.
- The requirements change can be accepted at any level of the project maintenance.
- All are participating in scrum meeting so that transparency can be maintained.
- Each and every sprint we are delivering to the client so we can maintain the customer's satisfaction and we can avoid delivery risk of the project.

Agile Process:
--------------
	Agile is an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional
teams and their customer/end user.

	Both Development and Testing Activities are concurrent unlike the waterfall model.

Epic, story, Task.

// functional requirement Document: which contains the which are specified by the customer.

Epic : it is large requirement.
Story: it is smaller Requirement.
Task: task is action which we need to perform on that partcular story.


	Ex: As a user I need to use Online Banking Application.

Story - 1 : As a user i can login into online Banking Application.
Story - 2: As a user i can check my balance in my account.
---
---
---

Story - 1 : As a user i can login into online Banking Application.

Development Task:
- Review the story
- Estimate the story
- Designing
- Code
- Unit Testing
- Integration Etc.

QA:
- Review the story
- Test CAses
- Test Scenarios
- Test Data
- Reviews
- Test Environment
- Execute Test Cases
- Report Bugs


Story: it is smaller Requirement.

Agile Roles:
------------

Product Owner: He is responsible for Epic, Story, Task. get the stories and create the stories based upon the features which are provided by the customer.
	       He will prepare the stories. 
	       Get the feature from the customer. he will prepare a story.

     Def:      Responsible for getting the Requirements from the Customer/Stakeholders.
		- Define the features of the product.
		- Decide on release date and content
		- Prioritize features according to market value
		- Adjust features and priority every iteration, as needed.
		- Accept or reject work results.

Scrum Master:
		- A scrum master is the facilatator for an Agile Development Team.
		- Enable close cooperation acroiss all roles and functions.
		- if there are any challenges, processing is delays, any blockers etc, scrum master is responsible to talk to the management.

DOR - Defination of Ready.
DOD - Defination of Done.

DOR - Defination of Ready.

- User stories is clear.
- user story is testable
- User story is feasible.
- User Story Defined
- User Story Acceptance Criteria Defined
- User story dependencies identified
- User story sized by Developement Team
- Scrum team accepts user Experience artefacts
- Performance criteria identified, where appropriate.
- scalability criteria Identified, where appropriate.
- Security criteria identified, where appropriate.
- Person who will accepts the User story is identified
- Team has a idea what it will mean to Demo the user story.

Sample Defination of Done.

- Code produced (All 'to do' itwms in code completed).
- Code commented, checked in and run aganist current version in source control.
- Peer reviewed(or produced with pair programming) and meeting development standards.
- Builds withour Errors.
- Unit Tests Written and Passing.
- Deployed to system test environment and passed system tests.
- Passed UAT(user Acceptance test) and signed off as meeting requirements.
- Any build / Deployment / Configuration changes are implemented / documented / Communicated.
- Relevant Documentation / diagrams produced and / or Updated.
- remaining hours for task set to Zero and Task closed.

Product Backlog:
----------------
		This is prepared by Product owner. which contains the requirements from the customer stories and epics.


In agile we don't have any Business Analyst. we have Product owner.


notes:
The release time will be divided in to multiple sprints. and every sprint we need to plan again. Every sprint Developers will do certain Activities and Tester will do 
certain Activities.

Development Task: Understanding requirements, setting up environments, creating unit tc, build creation.
-----------------

Tester Tasks: understand story, prepare test data, prepare test scenario, test cases, build deployement, functional testing, retesting, bug report.

Jira Tool:
----------

Test Management Tool: 
---------------------
		Whatever activities we are doing through out the testing process, through out the testing life cycle, we are tracking the task in a tool, these tool
consider as the Test Management Tool. 

	- we can define the requirements, we can write the test scenarios, test cases, report bugs, close bugs requirement. all these activities are Testing activities.
	

Bug Tracking tool/Defect tracking tool:
---------------------------------------
	whenever you find the bug, you can report the bug through that particular tool.
	

Agile Tools:
------------		-jira, Versionone, Teamcity....

Jira --> It is a Agile management tool
  
	i e includes development activities, testing activities product owner everybody  will track everything itself. we can also do test management activities.
jira itself not providing any Test management activities.

	create testcases, import test cases, we can create a test cycle. there is any failure reoprt the bugs. these are all test management activities.



Agile scrum activities:
----------------------- 
- How to create a project in Jira.
- How to add users/people in jira.

- how to create Backlog, Epic, & User stories in JIRA. --> Epic.
- How to create stories in Jira & add story points.

- Story points

- Backlog --> Epic --> Stories
- Createsprint --> Add stories to the sprint --> Start sprint --> Add tasks for every story.

Backlog: Product owner will create the backlog by taking the requirement from the customer. Backlog contain EPICs( 1 or more). Epic contain Stories.
--------

- Creating sprint in Jira : 3 to 4 weaks of time. onc we created a sprint then we have to select sum stories backlog 
                            add those stories from particular sprint.
- Adding user sub-tasks stories to sprint.
- Stating sprint.
- sprint life cycle.
- Adding sub-tasks to sprint.
- sprint life cycle.

what is sprint?

it is a cycle which contains 2 to 4 weaks of duration, with in the duration we have to implement few number of stories not all the stories.
once sprint is created commited stories then the responsibilities Developers and Testers.

Test Management Activities: (Zepyre plug-in)
---------------------------
	1). Test cases.
	2). Test cycles(Regression, Functional, Sanity Test cycle)
	3). Update Test cases passes/failed/blocked.
	4). Report bugs
	5). Reports

How to install zephyr plugin(test summary reports).
how to create test case in jira manually.
how to import multiple test cases into Jira tool(we have created Test cases manually pr we can imported test cases in jira tool).

Creating test cycles
Add test cases to cycle
Execute/Update test cases
Reporting Bugs
Reports in zephyr
Traceability Matrix


sinle place we can do everything: 
jira is agile test management tool so we r using cloud instance 

	Two kind of activities we can created in JIRA. we can do all agile related activities. i e we can create a project, we can add the user to particular project,
we can create a backlog, add the stories, create the sprint, we can move the stories to particular sprint. These activities we do in JIRA.
